THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE FILES OF THE PROJECTS That I did for spider Club Inductions, The research and development club of NITT.

My field of specialization being Opencv and Machine learning, I did projects on the following:
- Detecting the difference between 2 images and displaying the region of difference in a 5x5 LED matrix. https://youtu.be/iiv9mFa5Hlw
- Program to create aruco markers and and also detect them in any environment without using aruco library. https://youtu.be/D3e6Qik2fIY , https://youtu.be/MumlQuBkU_4
- Implementing Argumented reality. Creating a 3D object in blender and positioning the object at the place where an Aruco marker is detected. This project involved the use of OpenGL,OpenCV and Blender.

- Code using ML, without the use of any predefined ML libraries, the data related to lost locations of the city are given. The task is to predict the exact location of the Crime by the help Neural Networks algorithm. 
- Ideated on a project on my own. Accident alert system with the use of OpenCV and Machine Leaning
